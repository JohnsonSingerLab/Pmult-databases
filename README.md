# Pmult-databases
Databases developed for the genomic characterization of P. multocida isolates


#### Pmult_serogroup_genes.fasta
The Pmult_serogroup_genes.fasta file contains the nucleotide sequences and corresponding GenBank accession numbers for the genes used for *in-silico* capsular serogrouping of *P. multocida* whole-genome sequences.

#### Pmult_srl_genes.fasta
The Pmult_srl_genes.fasta file contains the nucleotide sequences for the genes used in a short nucleotide polymoprhism (SNP) analysis to distinguish *P. multocida* subp. *septica* genomes. These sequences were extracted from a pangenome reference file constructed from 656 *P. multocida* whole-genome sequences.

#### Pmult_vir_factors.fasta
The Pmult_vir_factors.fasta file contains the amino acid sequences and corresponding GenBank accession numbers of proteins that have previously been shown to be present in virulent strains of *P. multocida*.
